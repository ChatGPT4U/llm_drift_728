Step by step explanation: 

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2. If yes, then it is not a prime number. 
- 13177 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 

2. Check if the number is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of the number.

Step by step: 

1. Check if 12553 is divisible by 2. It is not, since it is an odd number. 
2. Check if 12553 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 16, which is not divisible by 3, so 12553 is not divisible by 3. 
3. Check if 12553 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 
4. Check if 12553 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 7. In this case, we get 1255 - 2(3) = 1249, which is not divisible by 7. 
5. Check if 12553 is divisible by 11. We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if we alternate adding and subtracting the digits of the number, the result should be divisible by 11. In this case, we get 1 - 2 + 5 - 5 + 3 = 2, which is not divisible by 11. 
6. Check if 12553 is divisible by 13. We can use the divisibility rule for 13, which states that if we subtract four times the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 13. In this case, we get 1255 - 4(3) = 1223, which is not divisible by 13. 

Since we have checked all primes up to the square root of 12553 and none of them divide it, we can conclude that 12553 is a prime number.

Step by step: 

1. Check if 6547 is divisible by 2. It is not, since the last digit is odd. 
2. Check if 6547 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 22, which is not divisible by 3. 
3. Check if 6547 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 
4. Check if 6547 is divisible by 7. This is a bit trickier, but we can use the following method: 
- Take the last digit (7) and double it: 7 x 2 = 14 
- Subtract this from the number formed by the remaining digits (654): 654 - 14 = 640 
- If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. In this case, 640 is not divisible by 7, so 6547 is not divisible by 7.

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 
2. To determine if 10069 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 
3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 10069. If it is, then 10069 is not a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 13177 is divisible by 2. Since 13177 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 13177 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 19) is not divisible by 3, so 13177 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 13177 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 13177 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 13177 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (1317 - 2 * 7 = 1303). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. However, this process is not feasible to perform manually.

5. We can continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers, but it is more efficient to use a calculator or a computer program to determine if 13177 is divisible by any prime number less than its square root.

After performing the necessary calculations, we find that 13177 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root. Therefore, we can conclude that 13177 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 12479 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 12479 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 7. To do this, we use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 2 * 9 = 18. Subtracting this from the remaining digits (1247) gives us 1247 - 18 = 1229. Since 1229 is not divisible by 7, 12479 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 11. To do this, we use the alternating sum of digits rule for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of digits is calculated as follows: 1 - 2 + 4 - 7 + 9 = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, 12479 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 12479 is divisible by 13. Since it is not immediately obvious, we can use a calculator or a computer program to determine that 12479 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 12479 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 12479 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 15467 is divisible by 2. Since 15467 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 15467 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 15467 (rounded down). The square root of 15467 is approximately 124.4, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 124.

3. We start checking if 15467 is divisible by 3. By performing the division, we find that 15467 is not divisible by 3 without a remainder.

4.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
12547 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 12547 is 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 12547 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
12547 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit (2 * 7 = 14) from the remaining truncated number (1254 - 14 = 1240). Since 1240 is divisible by 7, 12547 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check divisibility by 11, we can use the divisibility rule. Add and subtract alternate digits of the number: 1 + 5 + 7 = 13 and 2 + 4 = 6. Then, subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum: 13 - 6 = 7. Since 7 is not divisible by 11, 12547 is not divisible by 11.

12547 is not divisible by 13.

1. We start by checking if 7109 is divisible by 2. Since 7109 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 7109 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 7109 (7 + 1 + 0 + 9 = 17) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 7109 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process for higher prime numbers. Checking divisibility by 5, we see that 7109 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check divisibility by 7. We can use a similar method as before, adding up the digits of 7109 (7 + 1 + 0 + 9 = 17) and checking if the sum is divisible by 7. Since 17 is not divisible by 7, 7109 is not divisible by 7.
